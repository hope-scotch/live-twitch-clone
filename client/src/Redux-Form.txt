**** Without Redux ****

Class-based Component
state -> use 'state' to update 'value' in Input Element in DOM (input.value = current_value)
onChange -> called from Input Element to setState(value: current_value)

**** With Redux ****

[Redux-Store] Reducer -> mapStateToProps -> props [Component] -> value (Input Element) [DOM]
[Redux-Store] Reducer <- Redux Form Action Creator <- handler [Component] <- onChange (Input Element) [DOM]
Redux-based work done by redux-form library
Redux-Form Reducer is a special Reducer which has ALREADY been created for us by Redux to handle and manipulate forms
